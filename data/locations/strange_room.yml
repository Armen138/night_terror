title: A rough night
description:
  You wake up in a strange room. There is a portait on hanging on the wall, depicting 
  what looks like a happy family. They don't look familiar.
  There is a table in the center of the room, bearing a fruit bowl with a 
  single orange in it. It looks ripe.
  A door that looks like it leads outside is clumsily barricaded with scraps 
  of wood and rusty nails. One of the nails has fallen on the floor.
